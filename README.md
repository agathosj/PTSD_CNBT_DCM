## Cognitive Restructuring – Effective Connectivity Analyses

## Main Results
The Run_PEB_and_LOOCV_Diagnosis_CNBT.m script will reproduce the main DCM results comparing effective connectivity between PTSD patients and trauma-exposed controls during cognitive restructuring (discussed in-text and visualized in Figure 4A).

## Supplementary Results
The Run_PEB_and_LOOCV_Diagnosis_CNBT.m script will also reproduce the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) results predicting diagnostic status from modulation of MPFC-to-MDT connectivity during cognitive restructuring (Supplementary Figure SF1A).

The Run_LOOCV_PTCI.m script will reproduce the LOOCV results predicting posttraumatic cognitions in the PTSD group from modulation of MPFC-to-MDT connectivity during cognitive restructuring (Supplementary Figure SF1B-E).

## Notes
* Due to their large file size, the GCM files which contain subject-level DCM estimates (GCM.mat for the main DCM analyses; PTSD_GCM_PTCI.mat for supplementary LOOCV analyses within the PTSD group) should be downloaded separately and placed in the same directory as the .m script files.
